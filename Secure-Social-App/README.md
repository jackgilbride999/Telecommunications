# Securing Social Media Applications
The aim of this project is to develop a secure social media application for Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc., or for your own social networking app. For example, your application will secure the Facebook Wall, such that only people that are part of your "Secure Facebook Group" will be able to decrypt each other's posts. To all other users of the system the post will appear as ciphertext.

You are required to design and implement a suitable key management system for your application that allows any member of the gorup to share social media messages securely, and allows you to add or remove people from a group. You are free to implement your application for desktop or mobile platform and make use of any open source cryptographic libraries.
