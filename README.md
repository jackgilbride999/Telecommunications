# Publish-Subscribe
Java implementation of a Publish Subscribe protocol. Uses Datagrams to communicate between a subscriber, a broker and a publisher.

The code fromm Terminal.java as well as the Constructor and Listener class in Node.java were provided to give assistance with I/O and threading. The remaining code was written by me to build the Publish-Subscribe protocol.
